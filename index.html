				<p class="byline"> <i> <strong> By Lilli Iannella </strong> </i> </p>

				<p>The United States produced around 88.1 million tons of waste in 1960. In 2018, that number rose to about 292.4 million tons of waste. As the climate crisis has posed great impact in today’s society, sustainability has become an additional concern.</p>

				<p>The total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) has increased by about a fifth since 2000, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#Landfilling">according to figures</a> on a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The report covers generation by material from 1960 to 2018 and refers to trash, or MSW, as items consumers throw away after they are used. Although MSW does not include everything that may be landfilled at the local level, such as construction debris and other non-hazardous industrial wastes, MSW includes items such as bottles and corrugated boxes, food, grass clippings, sofas, computers, tires and refrigerators. 

				<p>In 2018, about 146.1 million tons of MSW were landfilled, accounting for half of the year's total MSP generation. Food waste was the largest component, accounting for about 24%.</p>

</script>

				<p>MSW generation rose considerably from 2017 to 2018 mainly because EPA enhanced its food measurement methodology to more fully account for all the ways wasted food is managed throughout the food system, according to the report.</p>
				<p>For the first time, the EPA utilized a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/food-material-specific-data">food measurement methodology</a> that managed animal feed, co-digestion/anaerobic digestion, bio-based materials/biochemical processing, donation, land application and sewer/wastewater treatment.</p>
				<p>From 2000 to 2018, MSW experienced a 20.54% increase in generation. Recycling generation experienced a 35.30% increase between the same years, while landfilling experienced a 4.18% increase. Combustion with and without energy recovery, however, experienced a 2.43% decrease in generation.</p>

				<p>Municipal solid waste landfills are the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the United States, accounting for approximately <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-information-about-landfill-gas">15% of emissions</a>, according to the EPA. Methane created from human action traps heat in the atmosphere to drive at least <a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=edf_none_upd_pmt&utm_medium=cpc&utm_id=1625243782&gclid=CjwKCAjwybyJBhBwEiwAvz4G7-Xfc2UZtKDm-bzm82wrY71P7nRRUZ5gadzdkwLuiWCPatXG3WkGJhoCNcAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">25%</a> of global warming.</p>
				<p>“Landfills contribute greatly to greenhouse gas emissions, notably methane, nitrous oxides and carbon dioxide, and at a minimum, (waste management industries) are aware and concerned,” said Douglas Daley, an associate professor at SUNY-ESF whose specialties include solid and hazardous waste management.</p>
				<p>Daley said that most modern landfills collect greenhouse gas emissions for energy recovery. He mentioned how both business and waste-smart processes may be carried out in effort toward sustainability, but no single approach is holistic.</p>
				<p>The EPA created a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smm/sustainable-materials-management-non-hazardous-materials-and-waste-management-hierarchy">waste management hierarchy</a> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change and recognize that no single waste management approach is suitable for managing all materials and waste in all circumstances. The hierarchy ranks management strategies from most to least sustainable, with the most preferred rank being source reduction and reuse and the least preferred rank being to dispose in landfills.</p>

				<p>Daley said that the most eco-friendly products are those that are reusable. If this isn’t possible, he said, then recyclable products are a second option. A problem though is that some industries do not have an integrated system of collection, transportation and waste management, he said.</p>
				<p>“A significant challenge though is that while a product may be “potentially” recyclable, if there is no system in place, or a market that is willing to collect, recycle and sell the materials, they won’t be recovered for recycling,” Daley said.</p>
				<p>In 2018, the recycling, composting, combustion with energy recovery and landfilling of MSW saved over 193 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2E), the report said. This is comparable to the emissions that could be reduced from taking almost 42 million cars off the road in a year, the report also said.</p>
				<p>Working toward sustainability should be a top priority for industries, Daley said. He said that the pros of more environmental-friendly processes such as reusing and recycling most often outweigh the cons, but many times, sustainable processes are not prioritized.</p>
				<p>“There are economic, social, marketing and environmental benefits for industries to pay attention to,” he said. “A challenge, though, is that wastes have always been an afterthought and aren’t part of the core mission.”</p>
				<p>In 2018, MSW generation represented 4.9 pounds per person per day. The rate in 1990 was 4.57 per capita, while in 1980 was 3.66, 1970 was 3.25 and 1960 was 2.68. From 1990 to 2018, the recycling rate has increased by almost 140%.</p>
				<p>About <a href="https://www.unep.org/interactive/beat-plastic-pollution/">9%</a> of plastics, globally, are estimated to be recycled. These plastics sit in landfills, in the environment and even in people’s local waterways, negatively affecting human and environmental health, said Laura Markley, a waste and plastics researcher in SU’s College of Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
				<p>“How we deal with the plastic problem has a direct impact on the safety, health and, potentially, livelihood of our local communities,” she said. “We have a collective responsibility to protect the environment, of course, but also the people and animals that live there.”</p>
